Easy and lightweight solution to preventively block third-party cookies installed by js and to comply with the EU cookie law.

== Description ==

EUROPEAN websites must follow the Commission's guidelines on [privacy and data protection](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/data_protection/index_en.htm "Guidelines on privacy and data protection") and inform users that cookies are not being used to gather information unnecessarily.

The [ePrivacy directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:HTML "ePrivacy directive") – more specifically Article 5(3) – requires prior informed consent for storage or for access to information stored on a user's terminal equipment. In other words, you must ask users if they agree to most cookies and similar technologies before the site starts to use them.

For **consent** to be valid, it must be **informed**, **specific**, **freely given** and must constitute a real indication of the individual's wishes.
